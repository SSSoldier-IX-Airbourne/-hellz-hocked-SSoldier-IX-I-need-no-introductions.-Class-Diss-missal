 To those who hate me, thank you.
 For you have made my heart strong.
 
 For those who love me, thank you.
 You make my heart worth beatin
 
 To those who have left me, thank you.
 You taught me that life has to change.
 
 And to those who have stuck with me, I am you.
 We are one. Always will be.
 
 Or something like that...
 
 _-Darius the Great.
